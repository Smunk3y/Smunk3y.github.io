                  ** Due to the format of this album, the songs will be listed as they are on the cd, 3 songs with the different parts listed **

                  F# A# ∞ By Godspeed You, Black Emperor was an enjoyable first listen. I've never listened to anything like it or even to similar bands. Buddy really likes them; after a short explanation, they sounded incredible. On my first listen, I was coding this site, but I had to stop to close my eyes and enjoy the album. I stopped coding the site shortly after the talking stop’s in The Dead Flag Blues, and it reminded me of tortoise, the only other “ Post Rock “ band I've listened to, even though they’re more electrical. I continuously listened to The Dead Flag Blues with great enjoyment up until about the 10-minute mark, where this eerie synth noise fades off, and a bass-guitar fades into the mix; by around 11 minutes, an electric guitar is playing alongside the bass, the 12-minute mark drums are in, and it's almost a completely different song. This blew my mind. The band did it exceptionally well, and once the old synth and other elements of the track came back into it, I was sold. The rest of this song is just fantastic, with a tiny little bell and what I assume to be a violin playing for the last two-ish minutes of the track. The first track on the album is so well thought out, executed, put together, and mastered that it could get its own review. After the first song, although I wanted to pause, I read online that the infinity part of the album relates to the fact that the album is a loop and each song fades into the next. It would be fantastic if a concept like this is well executed. A great album as a whole to listen to instead of more current projects where the goal is to get 1-3+ songs that everyone enjoys that will be “ hit “ songs where the artist in question can make loads of money and not have to worry about the other trash songs on the album. The second song, East Hastings, starts with what seems to be a guy preaching on the side of a busy street in a big city. Bagpipes slowly overtake the presence of the guy yelling until the noise of the cars and the preaching man are gone. A void-like synth takes over the bagpipes and is left to play out for a little bit. As it gets quieter and a guitar riff starts, the voidish synth takes over, and they go back and forth. The detail for the start of this song gives you an end-of-the-world kind of vibe between the voidy synth and the eerily affected guitar. They go back and forth for the first five minutes of the song, which really impacts the mood of the whole album.

	                 The album's whole idea, which seems to be a civilization heading to collapse or the end of the world, is prevalent in this section of the song. After this void section ends, instruments start to build up, playing faster and higher until they come to a stop. This relates back to the idea of civilization crashing. These kinds of thought-provoking sections of the album make it so enjoyable. The abstinence of lyrics in this album causes the listener to pay close attention to what words are said. These words seem to come from somewhat of a director of life, perhaps god considering the religious topics. But when there are no lyrics and not much going on, such as near the start of track 2, “ East Hastings, “ I was able to create an idea, somewhat of a picture in my mind of what this was trying to communicate. An album has never been able to paint such a picture in my mind. I'd assume it's cause of the lack of lyrics, but jazz doesn't do it as strongly. ** Song 3, “ Providence “ is absent on the vinyl and is only on the cd and Spotify. I did not find the final track as outstanding as the first two, but it was still amazing. Overall this album is fascinating and has some of the best-sounding instruments I've heard. Would recommend this album to anyone that can sit still; if you can't sit still, you will hate it.
