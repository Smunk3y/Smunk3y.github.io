                <p class="fontsz9">
                  I Enjoy listening to music and enjoy coding so I thought I'd make a website to share my opinions on music and try and improve my writing
                  skills with written reviews. Anything music-related may pop up in this section of the website, although any physical things such as listing equipment will be
                  listed in the vinyl section of the site. All of the opinions are mine and the written reviews are written by me, if you disagree with the reviews then that's tough cause it's my opinion, not yours, you can always
                  challenge it though. The Goal is about 1 Written review a week, and if I find extra time ill work on something like a top 10 list or a extra review.
                </p>

                <h1 class="centa">How To Use The Site</h1>

                <p class="fontsz9">

                  The nav bar at the very top is to switch between the main four sections of the site. Here in
                  the music section artists are divided into two categories, then into alphabet groups. Click on either HIP-HOP or
                  ROCK/ALT for the alphabet catagoires to pop down, then click the artists your looking for's respective alphabet group.
                   The alphabet groups are sorted by first and second letter only. Find your artist and click on him to find the rating's of their
                    albums ive listend to. If your only looking for written reviews click the REVIEW on the navbar to list written reviews.

                </p>

                <h1 class="centa">Written Reviews</h1>

                <p class="fontsz9">
                  Most albums will have just a number below them, but the ones in the review tab have a written review & tracklist rating to go along with it.
                  You can check the <a href="Review.html"><b>review</b></a> tab to search for a album with a written review, or when checking out a artist you can hover over the album, if it makes a
                  underline it's got a written review. Click on one's with underlines to see the reivew.

                <p class="fontsz9">
                  An idea stolen right from pitchfork, bets new music is a indicator to show that somthing is some of the best quality
                  and best made music to come out for that time it can only be applied to albums that i listened to when they first
                  came out. Example saba's album few good things was a album i listened to on release. It was the best album to come out
                  in a while, So it gets best new music. Somthing like illmatic wont get Best new music, as i did not listen to it close enough to relase
                  so it does not qualify for best new music.

                  <p class="fontsz12">
                    10 • Some of the best music ever <br>
                    9 • Almost a 10 but there are some problems with some bits <br>
                    8 • Fairly solid album some bad songs or underlying issues <br>
                    7 • Mostly good but some songs are not very good or there is a huge issue with the whole album <br>
                    6 • Just above average, Some good songs, Some bad songs, More good songs than bad songs <br>
                    5 • Average, Half of the songs are good or there is mostly bad songs but good one's are good <br>
                    4 • Album is not good, probably would never listen to it again <br>
                    3 • Did not enjoy the album at all although i made it through <br>
                    2 • The album was so bad i almost turned it off at multiple parts <br>
                    1 • Album has been blocked on spotify and made my brain hurt <br>

                    <p class="fontsz15">
                      If a aritst has a alter ego like MF DOOM they're reviews will be under the artists main page, example Viktor Vaughn's reviews will be under MF DOOM.
                      I dont feel a need to make a page for every single alter ego. If there is a group that a artist is in the group will have they're own page for reviews
                      i will try to link all group members on the page to they're own individual page. Any collab album/album's will be on both artists page, example Madvillainy
                      will be on both MF DOOM's page as well as Madlib's Page & Kids See Ghosts will be on both Kanye and Cudi's Page. A Artists name will be based of what the general population
                      calls them, Ex The Notorious B.I.G. will be listed under Biggie Smalls cuase that what everyone calls him.
