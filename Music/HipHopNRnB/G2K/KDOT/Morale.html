                  Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers is Kendrick Lamar's new album after the 5 year break that he took, whenever Kendrick drops you gotta keep in mind that he’s going to deliver a new sound and wont just repeat the same album as before just with new lyrics and beat’s. In the case of Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers it's closest to DAMN in terms of sound, that said it's still a sound that many in the hip hop world have not experimented with considering that some songs have multiple beat switches, the unique production style, super vulnerable lyricism and a non mainstream concept. Although this album does not seem as though it's one where you’d like a few songs and chuck them on your playlist, it seems more of an album where you’d sit down and listen to the whole thing whereas you only add one or two songs to your playlist. The Production on this album seems to be super precise, with songs like United In Grief and Count me out being both the intro track to each disk and having a very interesting beat switch multiple times. Kendrick dives into his personal life, internal conflicts, addiction and personal views on this new album, this has been attempted by other artists but most artists have done a half ass job when it comes to an introspective album. Kendrick does not seem to hold back in Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers he explains his problem with a sex addiction and how this caused him to have a affair on his good kid madd city tour, this affair took a toll on kendrick and considering he was married at the time does not help the situation. To have such a personal album while still making it sound good is a very hard task. My rambling and disordered thoughts about the album's structure to the actual music side of things. One of if not my favorite tracks on this album Die Hard has a very interesting production, just a simple drum loop with some heavy backing 808’s. With Kendrick singing on the record which is a newer thing he did a pretty good job, the lyrics on this track especially the ones near the end where Kendrick touches on how he’s letting past experiences and worries about his future, suppress his current happiness. The next track which is also one of my favorites Father time is very sonically sound with the amazing synths put in the back that come out of absolutely nowhere, along with sampha’s amazing singing, and a very groovy drum pattern. I’ve found on Mr. Morale drums are the main part of each beat while being backed by a simplistic synth or piano, this really shows on some songs where it almost feels like there is just the drums there and nothing with melody. Of course you have songs like Purple hearts where this is not the case as much as other songs. Moving onto The Big Steppers Kendrick starts to reflect on his problems that he faces on Mr. Morale and starts to solve them, it's more melodic and has some very heavy songs such as Mother I Sober, Mirror and Auntie diaries where he touches on some very touchy subjects. Mother I Sober is Kendrick's most introspective song he’s ever made where he dives into the fact that he cheated on his wife and how his internal criticism made him feel guilty about it. He talks about the sexual abuse that goes on within the black community and how was affected by it deeply. He explain how when he was 7 his cousin was accused of touching him and although kendrick said that he didn't no one believed him because it would not be out of reach for something like that to happen, due to the distrust of his family kendrick started to no longer trust himself. The line “ you aint felt grief till you felt it sober “ touches on how people will drown their grief, depression, anxiety with drugs and lust. Kendrick confronts the fact that he was guilty of the lust addiction and his wife's suggestion was therapy. For someone to touch on this many issues in a single song is a daunting task, although I feel kendrick did a great job doing so. The song savior Kendrick touches on the fact that people look up to him and other mainstream rappers so much that some would think they’re saviors, and Kendrick explains how he is not as great as some people make him out to be and that he is only human. The Final track on the album mirror is one of my favorites as Kendrick touches on the fact that a lot of people look up to him to guide them into doing better things, while others are looking up to kendrick he is working on fixing his own issues and “ rebuilding his world “, this also reflects to how some people expect shit from other people and support from them around them even while others are going through some tough shitt, some people are worried more about others than themself, Kendrick explains how he used to be under this umbrella but he now choses himself. There is alot to take away from Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers and I tried my best to stay on track during this review although I know that did not happen. For everyone to fully absorb the messages in Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers they should listen to the album without any other stimulation ( Dark room, headphones, eyes closed ) for those who have trouble taking in lyrics while listening i suggest you read them. This album has a ton to unpack and dissect and everyone should pull their own opinion on it. Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers is an amazing album and I would 100% listen again.

                  Ps : This is my first review and it was very jumbled, i hope to do better next time :)
