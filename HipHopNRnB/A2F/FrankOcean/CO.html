                Channel orange, is an amazing album by Frank Ocean, not the common favorite cause
                 it gets overshadowed by blond way too much as it's still an amazing album. The
                 storytelling on these songs is crazy good and some have very deep meanings, you could
                  look at this album in two different ways one way some good-sounding chill music or very
                   deep and rich in storytelling. You'll only find the deep storytelling and meanings if
                    you sit down do nothing and read the lyrics, or search online for them. One of my
                     Favorite Frank ocean songs "Pyramids" has got a very deep meaning behind it other than
                      the fact that it sounds good. The first part is about Cleopatra the great Egyptian ruler
                       and the 2nd half is about a modern-day woman whos a sex worker at the las vegas Pyramid
                        Hotel. A load of songs have super complex meanings and shine a light on some sort of racism
                        or problem in America. Bad Religion for example show's how the term " Allah Hu Akbar " has been
                         dragged through the dirt by the American culture when the exact translation just is " God is Great "
                         , amazing production and the fact that this album was made in 3 weeks is crazy with all the meanings
                         and relations to real life. There is a theory online about super-rich kids being about a rich kid who's
                          addicted to drugs and has all the money in the world not knowing the consequences of what could happen
                          and the fact that frankly says " there's nothing like this kind of view " would be in relation to an amazing
                           high that this drug-addicted teen can't get enough of. As well as the line " You'll say I jump I never do " is
                           in relation to the people close to him letting him know he's going to overdose but he thinks he's invincible. Overall
                           this album has amazing production and out-of-the-world storytelling. would 100% recommend a listen 9 / 10.
