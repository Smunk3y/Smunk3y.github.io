                  Twenty fourteen forest hill drive is the 3rd studio album by Jcole
                  and in my opinion his best, and one of his peaks. With his new stuff,
                  I think he will peak again before he retires. Back to the review, this album
                   starts off with one of my favorite intros of all time called intro. it sets the
                    tone real well it kind of explains the tone of this album. It then runs into January
                    28th which might be one of my favorite 3 songs runs ever, Wet Dreams, 03 Adolecndse
                    coming after it with January 28th being the weakest song. Wet dreams sample and storytelling
                     are amazing all though corny and odd. 03 adolescents are my favorite song o the album because
                      of the story and the hook. The whole album is amazing and the way jcole does not complicate the
                      storytelling or his lyrics, but still adds good depth to them allows you either sit down and
                      just breeze by with a nice calm listen or tear apart and dissect the lyrics, whereas with Kendrick
                       Lamar you have to really dig deep and really dissect his lyrics to get the full experience, jcole
                       is a nice and calmer alternative to Kendricks music with a very close level of production and great
                       skill. This album is a very cool experience and its very nice to see the wide range of jcole's skills as
                        he can sing, produce, rap and is a good storyteller, would recommend this album and give it a 8.5 / 10
