                <p>
                    Whole Lotta Red has some very interesting production,
                     the beats on this album were pretty good, but it was
                      neither the production nor the beats that left me unsatisfied.
                       It was the bloated tracklist and the very repetitive lyrics,
                        I understand the whole concert songs where they are meant
                        to be chanted at a concert on when you're having a good time
                         with your friends. But I don't think it works that well for
                         music you'd want to listen to any time alone or with 1 or 2
                         friends. As well as the vampire/punk whole ascetic is very
                         unappealing to me although I could see how some people like
                         it. The use of vocals is very interesting as after listening
                          to this album a few times you start to focus less on the
                          annoying moaning and more on the words that Carti is "Singing".
                           Some tracks on here were a little too repetitive for me like
                            jump out the house and meh whether it was the beat or the
                            lyrics. I feel like a lot of the longer songs on this album
                            could have used a little beat switch, the melodies were very
                             repetitive if they did not get switched up at all. I way I
                              think carti could have made this album a lot better along
                               with shortening it would have been having more features,
                                I do usually enjoy carti's when he has got a verse or 2
                                 on a track along with another 1 or 2 artists. Although
                                 I'm glad that he did not make a die-lit 2, The album
                                 would be a whole lot better if it was shorter. I much
                                 rather revisit his other album die lit over whole lotta
                                  red, a maybe listen 6.5/10
